turn:
    stages:
        action:
            moves:
                -- playCardEffect
                -- playCardEffectSpecial
                -- playCardValue
                -- playCardScuttle
                -- drawCard

if you play an effect, you should be able to enter a new stage
        effectStage:
            moves:
                --accept 
                --counter
if the opponent counters, you must have option to counter too, we can most likely call the same stage
        idle:
            moves:
                --literallyDoNothing //like there are legit no options



Example:
Turn: 0 (player0's turn)
    player 0 plays Ace as effect
    change stage now
        player0 enters idle stage    player1 enters effectStage stage
        player1 accepts effect
    stuff happens on field and hand
turn ends, now player1 turn

Turn: 1(player1 turn)
    player1 plays 3 as effect
    change stage now
        player0 enters effectStage stage    player1 enters idle stage
        player0 counters effect
        change stage now
            player0 enters idle stage    player1 enters effectStage stage
            player1 accepts
    stuff happens on field and hand
turn ends, now player0 turn

Turn: 2 (player0's turn)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
turnOrder:
player0 -> player1 -> player0 -> player1 ....

//on first turn, player0 must go be able to go
onBegin: (G, ctx) => {
      ctx.events.setActivePlayers({ currentPlayer: "action", others: "idle" });
},
//must check for winner at end of each turn
onEnd:(G,ctx) =>{
    checkForWinner(G);
},

this must occur independtly of stages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
how to setup stages
--ctx.events.setActivePlayers()

how to end turn
-- ctx.events.endTurn();


on each function that doesn't require a stage end, make it call endTurn


function playCardEffect(){
    //actual code goes here
    ctx.events.setActivePlayers(currentPlayer:"idle", others: "effectStage");
}

function accept(){
    //actual code goes here
    ctx.events.endTurn();
}

function counter(){
    //actual code goes here
    ctx.events.setActivePlayers(currentPlayer:"effectStage", others: "idle");
}



--TO DO--
if opponent doesn't have two the option to select for counter should be greyed out
need to check hand. probably return error if you try to counter without two in hand
